            How to Setup and Configure an OpenVPN Server on CentOS 6

   PostedMay 2, 2013 501.5k views [40]VPN [41]CentOS

  Introduction

   This article will guide you through the setup and configuration of OpenVPN
   server on your CentOS 6 cloud server. We will also cover how to configure
   your Windows, OS X, or Linux client to connect to your newly installed
   OpenVPN server.

   Before we begin, you'll need to have the Extra Packages for Enterprise
   Linux (EPEL) Repository enabled on your cloud server. This is a third
   party repository offered by the Fedora Project which will provide the
   OpenVPN package.

 wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
 rpm -Uvh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

Initial OpenVPN Configuration

   First, install the OpenVPN package from EPEL:

 yum install openvpn -y

   OpenVPN ships with only a sample configuration, so we will copy the
   configuration file to its destination:

 cp /usr/share/doc/openvpn-*/sample/sample-config-files/server.conf /etc/openvpn

   Now that we have the file in the proper location, open it for editing:

 nano -w /etc/openvpn/server.conf

   Our first change will be to uncomment the "push" parameter which causes
   traffic on our client systems to be routed through OpenVPN.

 push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"

   We'll also want to change the section that immediately follows route DNS
   queries to Google's Public DNS servers.

 push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8"
 push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.4.4"

   In addition, to enhance security, make sure OpenVPN drops privileges after
   startup. Uncomment the relevant "user" and "group" lines.

 user nobody
 group nobody

Generating Keys and Certificates Using easy-rsa

   Now that we've finished modifying the configuration file, we'll generate
   the required keys and certificates. As with the configuration file,
   OpenVPN places the required scripts in the documentation folder by
   default. Create the required folder and copy the files over.

 mkdir -p /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys
 cp -rf /usr/share/openvpn/easy-rsa/2.0/* /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa

   With the files in the desired location, we'll edit the "vars" file which
   provides the easy-rsa scripts with required information.

 nano -w /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars

   We're looking to modify the "KEY_" variables, located at the bottom of the
   file. The variable names are fairly descriptive and should be filled out
   with the applicable information.

   Once completed, the bottom of your "vars" file should appear similar to
   the following:

 export KEY_COUNTRY="US"
 export KEY_PROVINCE="NY"
 export KEY_CITY="New York"
 export KEY_ORG="Organization Name"
 export KEY_EMAIL="administrator@example.com"
 export KEY_CN=droplet.example.com
 export KEY_NAME=server
 export KEY_OU=server

   OpenVPN might fail to properly detect the OpenSSL version on CentOS 6. As
   a precaution, manually copy the required OpenSSL configuration file.

 cp /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/openssl-1.0.0.cnf /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/openssl.cnf

   We'll now change into our working directory and build our Certificate
   Authority, or CA, based on the information provided above.

 cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
 source ./vars
 ./clean-all
 ./build-ca

   Now that we have our CA, we'll create our certificate for the OpenVPN
   server. When asked by build-key-server, answer yes to commit.

 ./build-key-server server

   We're also going to need to generate our Diffie Hellman key exchange files
   using the build-dh script and copy all of our files into /etc/openvpn as
   follows:

 ./build-dh
 cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys
 cp dh1024.pem ca.crt server.crt server.key /etc/openvpn

   In order to allow clients to authenticate, we'll need to create client
   certificates. You can repeat this as necessary to generate a unique
   certificate and key for each client or device. If you plan to have more
   than a couple certificate pairs be sure to use descriptive filenames.

 cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
 ./build-key client

Routing Configuration and Starting OpenVPN Server

   Create an iptables rule to allow proper routing of our VPN subnet.

 iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
 service iptables save

   Then, enable IP Forwarding in sysctl:

 nano -w /etc/sysctl.conf

 # Controls IP packet forwarding
 net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

   Finally, apply our new sysctl settings. Start the server and assure that
   it starts automatically on boot:

 sysctl -p
 service openvpn start
 chkconfig openvpn on

   You now have a working OpenVPN server. In the following steps, we'll
   discuss how to properly configure your client.

Configuring OpenVPN Client

   Now that your OpenVPN server is online, lets configure your client to
   connect. The steps are largely the same regardless of what operating
   system you have.

   In order to proceed, we will need to retrieve the ca.crt, client.crt and
   client.key files from the remote server. Simply use your favorite SFTP/SCP
   (Secure File Transfer Protocol/Secure Copy) client and move them to a
   local directory. You can alternatively open the files in nano and copy the
   contents to local files manually. Be aware that the client.crt and
   client.key files will are automatically named based on the parameters used
   with "./build-key" earlier. All of the necessary files are located in
   /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys

 nano -w /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/ca.crt
 nano -w /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/client.crt
 nano -w /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/client.key

   With our certificates now on our client system, we'll create another new
   file called client.ovpn, where "client" should match the name of the
   client being deployed (from build-key), the contents should be as follows,
   substituting "x.x.x.x" with your cloud servers IP address, and with the
   appropriate files pasted into the designated areas. Include only the
   contents starting from the "BEGIN" header line, to the "END" line, as
   demonstrated below. Be sure to keep these files as confidential as you
   would any authentication token.

 client
 dev tun
 proto udp
 remote x.x.x.x 1194
 resolv-retry infinite
 nobind
 persist-key
 persist-tun
 comp-lzo
 verb 3
 <ca>
 Contents of ca.crt
 </ca>
 <cert>
 Contents of client.crt
 </cert>
 <key>
 Contents of client.key
 </key>

   As all of the required information to establish a connection is now
   centralized in the .ovpn file, we can now deploy it on our client system.

   On Windows, regardless of edition, you will need the official [42]OpenVPN
   Community Edition binaries which come prepackaged with a GUI. The only
   step required post-installation is to place your .ovpn configuration file
   into the proper directory (C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config) and click
   connect in the GUI. OpenVPN GUI on Windows must be executed with
   administrative privileges.

   On Mac OS X, the open source application [43]"Tunnelblick" provides an
   interface similar to OpenVPN GUI on Windows, and comes prepackagd with
   OpenVPN and required TUN/TAP drivers. As with Windows, the only step
   required is to place your .ovpn configuration file into the
   ~/Library/Application Support/Tunnelblick/Configurations directory.

   On Linux, you should install OpenVPN from your distributions official
   repositories. You can then invoke OpenVPN by simply executing:

 sudo openvpn --config ~/path/to/client.ovpn

   Congratulations! If you made it this far you should now have a fully
   operational VPN running on your cloud server. You can verify that your
   traffic is being routed through the VPN by [44]checking Google to reveal
   your public IP.
