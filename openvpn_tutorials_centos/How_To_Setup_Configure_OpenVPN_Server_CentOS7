            How To Setup and Configure an OpenVPN Server on CentOS 7

   PostedDecember 3, 2014 214.2k views [44]VPN [45]Firewall [46]CentOS

  Introduction

   We're going to install and configure OpenVPN on a CentOS 7 server. We'll
   also discuss how to connect a client to the server on Windows, OS X, and
   Linux.

   OpenVPN is an open-source VPN application that lets you create and join a
   private network securely over the public Internet.

Prerequisites

   You should complete these prerequisites:

     * CentOS 7 Droplet
     * root access to the server (several steps cannot be completed with just
       sudo access)
     * Domain or subdomain that resolves to your server that you can use for
       the certificates

   Before we start we'll need to install the Extra Packages for Enterprise
   Linux (EPEL) repository. This is because OpenVPN isn't available in the
   default CentOS repositories. The EPEL repository is an additional
   repository managed by the Fedora Project containing non-standard but
   popular packages.

 yum install epel-release

Step 1 — Installing OpenVPN

   First we need to install OpenVPN. We'll also install Easy RSA for
   generating our SSL key pairs, which will secure our VPN connections.

 yum install openvpn easy-rsa -y

Step 2 — Configuring OpenVPN

   OpenVPN has example configuration files in its documentation directory.
   We're going to copy the sample server.conf file as a starting point for
   our own configuration file.

 cp /usr/share/doc/openvpn-*/sample/sample-config-files/server.conf /etc/openvpn

   Let's open the file for editing.

 vi /etc/openvpn/server.conf

   There are a few lines we need to change in this file. Most of the lines
   just need to be uncommented (remove the ;). Other changes are marked in
   red.

   When we generate our keys later, the default Diffie-Hellman encryption
   length for Easy RSA will be 2048 bytes, so we need to change the dh
   filename to dh2048.pem.

 dh dh2048.pem

   We need to uncomment the push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp" line,
   which tells the client to redirect all traffic through our OpenVPN.

 push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"

   Next we need to provide DNS servers to the client, as it will not be able
   to use the default DNS servers provided by your Internet service provider.
   We're going to use Google's public DNS servers, 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.

   Do this by uncommenting the push "dhcp-option DNS lines and updating the
   IP addresses.

 push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8"
 push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.4.4"

   We want OpenVPN to run with no privileges once it has started, so we need
   to tell it to run with a user and group of nobody. To enable this you'll
   need to uncomment these lines:

 user nobody
 group nobody

   Save and exit the OpenVPN server configuration file.

Step 3 — Generating Keys and Certificates

   Now that the server is configured we'll need to generate our keys and
   certificates. Easy RSA installs some scripts to generate these keys and
   certificates.

   Let's create a directory for the keys to go in.

 mkdir -p /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys

   We also need to copy the key and certificate generation scripts into the
   directory.

 cp -rf /usr/share/easy-rsa/2.0/* /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa

   To make life easier for ourselves we're going to edit the default values
   the script
   uses so we don't have to type our information in each time. This
   information is stored
   in the vars file so let's open this for editing.

 vi /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars

   We're going to be changing the values that start with KEY_. Update the
   following values to be accurate for your organization.

   The ones that matter the most are:

     * KEY_NAME: You should enter server here; you could enter something
       else, but then you would also have to update the configuration files
       that reference server.key and server.crt
     * KEY_CN: Enter the domain or subdomain that resolves to your server

   For the other values, you can enter information for your organization
   based on the variable name.

 . . .

 # These are the default values for fields
 # which will be placed in the certificate.
 # Don't leave any of these fields blank.
 export KEY_COUNTRY="US"
 export KEY_PROVINCE="NY"
 export KEY_CITY="New York"
 export KEY_ORG="DigitalOcean"
 export KEY_EMAIL="sammy@example.com"
 export KEY_OU="Community"

 # X509 Subject Field
 export KEY_NAME="server"

 . . .

 export KEY_CN=openvpn.example.com

 . . .



   We're also going to remove the chance of our OpenSSL configuration not
   loading due to the version being undetectable. We're going to do this by
   copying the required configuration file and removing the version number.

 cp /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/openssl-1.0.0.cnf /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/openssl.cnf

   To start generating our keys and certificates we need to move into our
   easy-rsa directory and source in our new variables.

 cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
 source ./vars

   Then we will clean up any keys and certificates which may already be in
   this folder and generate our certificate authority.

 ./clean-all

   When you build the certificate authority, you will be asked to enter all
   the information we put into the vars file, but you will see that your
   options are already set as the defaults. So, you can just press ENTER for
   each one.

 ./build-ca

   The next things we need to generate will are the key and certificate for
   the server. Again you can just go through the questions and press ENTER
   for each one to use your defaults. At the end, answer Y (yes) to commit
   the changes.

 ./build-key-server server

   We also need to generate a Diffie-Hellman key exchange file. This command
   will take a minute or two to complete:

 ./build-dh

   That's it for our server keys and certificates. Copy them all into our
   OpenVPN directory.

 cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys
 cp dh2048.pem ca.crt server.crt server.key /etc/openvpn

   All of our clients will also need certificates to be able to authenticate.
   These keys and certificates will be shared with your clients, and it's
   best to generate separate keys and certificates for each client you intend
   on connecting.

   Make sure that if you do this you give them descriptive names, but for now
   we're going to have one client so we'll just call it client.

 cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
 ./build-key client

   That's it for keys and certificates.

Step 4 — Routing

   To keep things simple we're going to do our routing directly with iptables
   rather than the new firewalld.

   First, make sure the iptables service is installed and enabled.

 yum install iptables-services -y
 systemctl mask firewalld
 systemctl enable iptables
 systemctl stop firewalld
 systemctl start iptables
 iptables --flush

   Next we'll add a rule to iptables to forward our routing to our OpenVPN
   subnet, and save this rule.

 iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
 iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables

   Then we must enable IP forwarding in sysctl. Open sysctl.conf for editing.

 vi /etc/sysctl.conf

   Add the following line at the top of the file:

 net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

   Then restart the network service so the IP forwarding will take effect.

 systemctl restart network.service

Step 5 — Starting OpenVPN

   Now we're ready to run our OpenVPN service. So lets add it to systemctl:

 systemctl -f enable openvpn@server.service

   Start OpenVPN:

 systemctl start openvpn@server.service

   Well done; that's all the server-side configuration done for OpenVPN.

   Next we'll talk about how to connect a client to the server.

Step 6 — Configuring a Client

   Regardless of your client machine's operating system, you will definitely
   need a copy of the ca certificate from the server, along with the client
   key and certificate.

   Locate the following files on the server. If you generated multiple client
   keys with unique descriptive names, then the key and certificate names
   will be different. In this article we used client.

 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/ca.crt
 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/client.crt
 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/client.key

   Copy these three files to your client machine. You can use [47]SFTP or
   your preferred method. You could even open the files in your text editor
   and copy and paste the contents into new files on your client machine.

   Just make sure you make a note of where you save them.

   We're going to create a file called client.ovpn. This is a configuration
   file for an OpenVPN client, telling it how to connect to the server.

     * You'll need to change the first line to reflect the name you gave the
       client in your key and certificate; in our case, this is just client
     * You also need to update the IP address from your_server_ip to the IP
       address of your server; port 1194 can stay the same
     * Make sure the paths to your key and certificate files are correct

 client
 dev tun
 proto udp
 remote your_server_ip 1194
 resolv-retry infinite
 nobind
 persist-key
 persist-tun
 comp-lzo
 verb 3
 ca /path/to/ca.crt
 cert /path/to/client.crt
 key /path/to/client.key

   This file can now be used by any OpenVPN client to connect to your server.

   Windows:

   On Windows, you will need the official [48]OpenVPN Community Edition
   binaries which come with a GUI. Then, place your .ovpn configuration file
   into the proper directory, C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config, and click
   Connect in the GUI. OpenVPN GUI on Windows must be executed with
   administrative privileges.

   OS X:

   On Mac OS X, the open source application [49]Tunnelblick provides an
   interface similar to the OpenVPN GUI on Windows, and comes with OpenVPN
   and the required TUN/TAP drivers. As with Windows, the only step required
   is to place your .ovpn configuration file into the ~/Library/Application
   Support/Tunnelblick/Configurations directory. Or, you can double-click on
   your .ovpn file.

   Linux:

   On Linux, you should install OpenVPN from your distribution's official
   repositories. You can then invoke OpenVPN by executing:

 sudo openvpn --config ~/path/to/client.ovpn

  Conclusion

   Congratulations! You should now have a fully operational virtual private
   network running on your OpenVPN server.

   After you establish a successful client connection, you can verify that
   your traffic is being routed through the VPN by [50]checking Google to
   reveal your public IP.
