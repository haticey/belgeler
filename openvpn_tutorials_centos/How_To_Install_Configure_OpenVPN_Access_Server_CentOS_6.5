      How To Install and Configure an OpenVPN Access Server on CentOS 6.5

   PostedApril 4, 2014 95.3k views [42]VPN [43]Networking [44]CentOS

  Introduction

   VPN, or virtual private network, is a secure method of connecting remote
   internet resources together as if they were under the same LAN. OpenVPN is
   a popular implementation that works on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating
   systems and can be utilized to create complex, encrypted networks between
   physically dispersed servers.

   The OpenVPN Access Server is a solution built on top of traditional
   OpenVPN that is used as a complete portal for managing connections, users,
   and interfaces. It provides the underlying VPN instance, a web interface
   for managing the suite, and a client that can be used within a web
   browser.

   In this guide, we'll install and configure the OpenVPN Access Server on a
   CentOS 6.5 VPS instance.

Download and Install Packages

   We can obtain the OpenVPN Access Server package for CentOS from the
   [45]project's website.

   Right click on the package that matches your version of CentOS and your
   machine's architecture. Select the "copy link address" item or whatever
   option is closest.

   On your CentOS droplet, download the package with curl -O (that's the
   letter "o" not a zero) followed by the URL you copied from the page. In my
   case, this turned out to be:

 cd ~
 curl -O http://swupdate.openvpn.org/as/openvpn-as-2.0.5-CentOS6.x86_64.rpm

   When the package has been downloaded, you can install it with using the
   rpm command:

 sudo rpm -i openvpn-as-2.0.5-CentOS6.x86_64.rpm

   After installing the package, an administration account is created called
   openvpn. However, no password has been set.

   Set a password for the administrator's account by typing:

 sudo passwd openvpn

   Now, the command line configuration steps are complete. The rest of the
   guide will focus on configuring options through the web interface.

Accessing the Web Interface

   We can access our VPN portal by going to our server's IP address or domain
   name, at port 943. The server operates using TLS, so we will need to
   specify the https protocol.

   For our initial interaction, we actually want to go to the administrative
   interface, which is the same, except ending with /admin:

 https://server_ip_or_domain:943/admin

   You will get a warning that the site's SSL certificates are not trusted:

   [46][OpenVPN access server ssl warning]

   This is expected and perfectly fine. All that this is telling us is that
   OpenVPN is using a self-signed SSL certificate, which is not trusted by
   default by our browser. We can click on the "Proceed anyway" button or
   whatever similar option you have.

   You will be presented with the admin login page. Use the username openvpn
   and the password you set for this user:

   [47][OpenVPN access admin login]

   You will be taken to the OpenVPN Access Server's EULA, which you will have
   to agree to if you wish to continue:

   [48][OpenVPN access EULA]

   Once you log in, you can see the administrative interface, complete with
   some useful at-a-glance stats on the landing page:

   [49][OpenVPN admin landing]

   Here, you can configure your VPN server. The access server separates the
   web interface and the actual VPN access and each can be configured
   independently.

   For instance, if you go to the Server Network Settings in the left-hand
   menu, you will see a page where you can configure the port and interface
   that each component operates on. You can also specify the address pool
   that will be available to the clients.

   Another thing you might want to do is add users and configure the
   authentication methods. You can add VPN users that match your system
   users, or add users that you might be controlling through an LDAP server.

Logging in as a Client

   When you are finished configuring things as an admin, you can visit the
   client portion by going to your IP address or domain name followed by port
   943:

 https://server_ip_or_domain:943

   You will have to type in a username of a user that you have configured VPN
   access for:

   [50][OpenVPN client login]

   If you the user that you logged in as has been designated as an OpenVPN
   admin account, you will see an "Admin" button that can be used to take you
   back to the admin control panel. Either way, you will be taken to a page
   that will allow you to download software for your client to connect to the
   VPN server:

   [51][OpenVPN client software]

   If your desktop is Windows or OS X, or if you have an android or iOS
   device, you can download an OpenVPN Connect client that will operate
   within your browser. If your desktop is a Linux machine, you will be asked
   to download the normal VPN client.

   You should follow the directions of the client of your choice. If you are
   using the Linux client, you'll need to download the connection settings
   profile by clicking on the "Yourself" link:

   [52][OpenVPN download yourself]

   Using the regular Linux openvpn client, you can connect using something
   like this:

 sudo openvpn --config client.ovpn

Conclusion

   Now, you should have a portal that can be used to configure your VPN
   access. This is an easy to manage interface that can be set up once and
   configured on-the-fly. It automatically generates valid configuration
   files for your users to connect to the server, which can save a lot of
   headaches with explaining how to configure access.
